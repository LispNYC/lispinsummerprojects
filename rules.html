DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTEST:</b> LispNYC’s Lisp In Summer Projects (the “Contest”) is designed to (1) encourage and inspire people to begin participating in open source development, (2) help open source projects identify and bring in new contributors, and (3) provide people interested in computer science and other fields with exposure to real-world Lisp-based software development, including coding work, documentation and open source community involvement.
</p>
<p>Judges from LispNYC will choose winning entries in accordance with these Lisp In Summer Projects Rules (“Contest Rules”) and prizes will be awarded to eligible winning Participants.
